# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

PyBer is a ride-share company that is Python based. The task at hand is to analyze large CSV files containing-ride share data and visualize the information through various graphs using Matplotlib and the Pandas library. After initial analysis, PyBer has requested a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing information by city type. Then, the company would like to see the total weekly fares for each city type through a multiple-line graph created through Pandas and Matplotlib. The two items that were created are as follows:
  1. Ride-share summary DataFrame by city type.
  2. Multiple line chart of total fares for each city type.
  
## Results

The results of the analysis present major differences in PyBer ride-sharing data among the various city types. The three city types that were analyzed in this project were Rural, Urban, and Suburban. The Urban city type had the highest amount of total rides (1,625), total drivers (59,602), and total fares ($39,854.38). Although the Urban city type contained the largest amount of rides, drivers, and fares, it had the lowest average fare per ride and fare per driver. Urban cities only receive $24.53  per ride and only an average of $1 per driver. The Rural city type contained the highest average fare per ride and fare per driver. Rural fare rides have an average of $34.62 and an average driver fare of $8. Also, the multiline graph reveals that the Urban city type has the highest weekly total fair. In February 2019, the Urban weekly total fare spiked up to $2,500 compared to the Suburban and Rural city type's highest weekly fare of $1,400 and $500 respectively.

## Summary

Based on the results, there are three business recommendations to address disparities among the city types. The first recommendation would be to improve upon the fare per ride and fare per driver for the Urban city type. Although Urban cities do have higher total fares and rides, the prices of those individual rides are the lowest among the three city types. To create more profitability for drivers, PyBer should slightly increase the ride fare which will therefore, increase pay for the drivers. This will hopefully incentivize more drivers to work for PyBer and increase the amount of PyBer rides in Urban cities. The second recommendation is to discount rides in Rural and Suburban areas. Rural and Suburban fares have lower total rides and drivers, but have the highest fare per ride and fare per driver. To increase incentives for more Rural and Suburban civillians to use PyBer as their main ride-share platform, promotions for discount off of rides would sharply increase PyBer's customer pool. The third recommendation would be to work on a marketing strategy for PyBer in the Rural cities. The weekly total fare for Rural cities was at a low of $500 compared to Urban cities which had a high weekly fare of $2,500. Marketing PyBer in Rural cities in addition to the promotion could increase profitability and create community awareness of the PyBer application.
